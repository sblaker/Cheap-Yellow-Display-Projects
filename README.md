This project transforms an ESP32 (or ESP8266) and a TFT display into an elegant IoT digital frame. Each day, the device autonomously wakes up to download the latest Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) directly from NASA's APIs.

After displaying the image, it enriches the view by overlaying real-time weather data for a specific location (in this case, Palermo), fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.

By leveraging "deep sleep," the device ensures extremely high power efficiency, making it ideal for continuous, 24/7 operation.
